                            <img src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/683757a081d72f81ecd1304b/1:1/w_450%2Cc_limit/AlexG_Headlights_Cover.jpg"
                                alt="headlights album cover" class="post-media-left">
                            This album is full of warmth and honesty. Neither are new for Alex G but its never sounded
                            quite so refined. To me this album is about accepting change, and the mixed emotions that
                            can come with even the most positive of changes.
                            This is his first album produced under a major label and the lyrics explicitly discuss this
                            change, almost as if he's trying to apologize for selling out, or at least come to terms
                            with himself about it. The low fidelity style of his older albums were always part of his
                            appeal, but I don't feel his voice is lost in the layers of production.
                            If anything this album seems more mature and honest. The other large change influencing the
                            album is a distinct difference in lifestyle now that he's a father. If God Save the Animals
                            was about becoming a father, Headlights is about accepting the change in lifestyle and maybe
                            even mourning the loss of a previous identity. Good stuff. I like it. Some of my favourite
                            tracks are Beam Me Up, Real Thing, and Far and Wide.

                            <p>One of the reasons i wanted to start curating things i love is because i often have
                                difficulty translating my feelings into words and i want to improve that. I really
                                really love this song. It is very special and beautiful to me. It makes me sad and happy
                                and mournful and hopeful. Her voice is really amazing. Lyrically and musically this song
                                is almost perfectly addicting. I am clearly not quite there in terms of articulating
                                myself. I like it a lot</p>

                                I was very upset to hear that Brian Wilson died today. I don't even know if he was doing
                                this at all in like the last twenty years but I always kind of thought I might get to
                                see him perform live. I've been listening to The Beach Boys all day, the first time in a
                                few years I've done a deep dive into them. I really think they're the best pop band of
                                all time. </p>

                                Sufjan Stevens. He recently rereleased Carrie & Lowell for its 10th Anniversary with a
                                bunch of demos. Really love that album. Just beautiful poetic soft sad meaningful tunes.
                                You have got to love it. The weather is perfect for melancholic melodies such as his.
