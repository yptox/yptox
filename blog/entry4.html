          <p> I had the pleasure of seeing a few great musical acts at The Old Bar. I don't know how old it actually is, but it's a pretty good name for a bar regardless.
            Hugh played some splendid folk songs that made me feel very warm and smiley. The Great Divides were fantastic - any band with a saxophone and a violin is 
        a band i like very much. I particularly enjoyed their song <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/24HZevCpeNLAF0WLFbGKrQ?si=19OeRnPSTH6x09f0frHChg&context=spotify%3Aalbum%3A16SQbLipCSDRwSupWJ4CBw">European Domination.</a>
    I too often do the dishes late. Strawberry Prince and his band played some songs that were at points both delightfully reserved and emotional, and ear-splittingly heavy. I loved it! I had a
really great time. I need to go to live music acts every day forever.</p>
