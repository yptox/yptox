          <p> Don Tojo is a Japanese restaurant near me that is ok and cheap. Sometimes I go there if I want a decent cheap meal. I have never gotten sick from eating there but I fear the day is approaching. The food is really not amazing but it is cheaper than like anything else around me. That being said it's still like minimum $12 which is fucked up. They are also very quick, I think maybe they just heat up the ingredients when someone orders something. I know for sure they make a shit ton of rice and use it through the day because if you go there late the rice is really bad.
