           At around 37 seconds into Out Getting Ribs by King Krule there is a very lovely guitar riff that I think about a lot. It is unique in how it sounds and how it is played.
           I am not very good at guitar and I gave up trying to learn it but I hope to one day try again. There's a video of a guy on youtube doing it on an acoustic guitar in a forest
           and it is very pleasant. The riff plays again a few times in the song and it makes me feel very nice every time. Music!! Love to listen to it!! Who else loves to straight up rock out. 
           I can't be the only one
