         <p> I have many good things that I think about sports writer Jon Bois, but I don't really know exactly what to type about him. His works include 
            17776, an web-based story about the future of football which is one of my favourite things of all ever, and an extensive collection
            of feature length statistic-based youtube documentaries. What a guy! He's recently continued posting videos in his series "Pretty Good",
            which is some of the best content available in my opinion. His format of using 3d graphs as a visualiser for storytelling is very creatively
            inspiring to me. He make me smile.
