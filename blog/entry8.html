        <h1>10-4-25 - naturalorder</h1>
<a href="https://noper.xyz/works/naturalorder"> naturalorder</a> is a series of artworks by generative artist Noper. It is very neat stuff. I've come across a few things like this before, but I feel
like this collection is the best example of video work using movement. The natural movements of waves crashing and smoke billowing fit together perfectly
and the way the generation combines and mixes the two is super fascinating. The style of these pieces reminds me of earlier ai generated videos, and I feel 
that's likely intentional given how far these models have come. It's very inspiring and I want to begin making stuff like it as soon as my new PC arrives. I feel
there is so much unexplored with these models in terms of creative work. These tools are so incredibly powerful but it seems like people are so fucking
unimaginative with the way they use them. Yes, obviously they can generate a shitty looking cartoon. Newer models can generate images that are indistinguishable
from realistic photographs. But why aren't people actually using these tools to create? Use the medium for something other than creating a soulless and shitty version of
something millions of people are already making? I feel like I'm crazy. People aren't seeing what you can actually do with these things. The interesting stuff lies
in pushing the limits of these models and embracing their imperfection and surreality. I do feel conflicted. There are such negative connotations with AI art that I feel
judged whenever I talk about their potential. At the end of the day these generative models are a tool like any other and they can be used in creative and non creative ways, ethical and non ethical ways.
I want to use these tools to make something new,
but almost everything I see made with them is completely worthless. This collection challenged that for me, and I need to seek out more like it.
