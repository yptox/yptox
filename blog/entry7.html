            Eric's Trip is a band that I came across on recommendation from my buddy Spotify. I had listened to a few songs by them
            but today I went through their discography and enjoyed it very much so. They have three studio albums released from 1993 to 1996 as well
            as a live concert album. Good stuff for anyone who enjoys that sort of lo-fi 90s rock. Little bit Red House Painters, little bit Mazzy Star.
            Some songs are better than others but most are good! They have officially been added to the repertoire.
