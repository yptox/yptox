         Sleep is something that I neglected for a long time in my teenage years. I used to love staying up late and doing nothing. 
         Watching youtube videos, scrolling through instagram, thinking about every mistake I ever had or could make. In my early adulthood
         I have grown extremely fond of sleep and its effects. Obviously it is a key human need but I feel like the effects of good sleep 
         make a pretty incredible difference. I've found myself in a position opposite to my younger self, and not necessarily for the better.
         I love sleep maybe a little bit too much. For about three months now I've fairly consistently been getting 8-12 hours of sleep a day/night 
         and I think it might actually be negatively affecting me. I just love it so much. When I was in a motivated schedule I set my alarm to 6 am,
         and I've left it that way for a while now. Every morning I wake up at 6 am, turn my alarm off, and have the most amazing feeling sleep. 
         It don't know, maybe it's fine but it almost feels too good to be true. There's something about that state of having woken up and then immediately
         returning to sleep that feels like indescribably blissful. Something about shirking responsibilities, returning to that warm and cozy nothingness.
         I fucking love it. I just feel like it is maybe not good for me. I'm not going to stop though, at least not until I get proper confirmation that it's unhealthy.
