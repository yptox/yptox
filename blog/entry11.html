Plaything is an episode of the new season of Black Mirror. It's sort of a sequel to Bandersnatch, the choose your own adventure
style experience they released a few years back. That was one of my favourite things Netflix has ever done, so I was looking forward
to this episode, and this season as a whole. The consensus on Black Mirror generally is that the first four seasons are pretty great 
but the next two have not been recieved as well. I personally have always thought the show was a little unbalanced in terms of quality -
I think the nature of an anthology series is that an individual is always going to prefer some episodes over others, but I think some concepts
the show explores are really just not as interesting as others. Anyway, what I've experienced of season seven has been a bit of a return to form 
so far. I only watched Common People (episode 1) and Plaything (episode 4?), but I thought they were quite solid. Common People was as depressing 
as old Black Mirror ever got, and Plaything was a great look back into the style of Bandersnatch. Plaything is limited from being the same sort of
experience as Bandersnatch due to being a fully linear experience without any interactivity, but the style of the visuals and writing definitely 
remind me of my favourite parts of Bandersnatch. They share the same director and some secondary characters, but it's far from a rehash of the same story.
Plaything opens in a near future of 2034, where we witness Peter Capaldi's character (I really loved him in this) arrested for DNA ties to a long abandoned murder case. What unfolds is 
a series of flashbacks to a world parallel to Bandersnatch, if not definitively taking place in one of those branching narratives. Will Poulter's character makes
a short cameo which I absolutely loved. This character is fantastic. I want to see more of him. Anyway, the story is exciting and interesting and good in many ways!
Easily my favourite episode of Black Mirror since White Christmas, or USS Calisster which also gets a direct sequel this season. Hoping that can live up to its predecessor.
