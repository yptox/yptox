          <p>Forever Howlong is the new album by Black Country, New Road. I didn't like it the first time I listened to it, which was today, but I have since listened to it maybe five more times and I have come around on it a little bit.
            Maybe a lot, actually. I think I've actually had this same experience with everything I've listened to by BCNR - when they were first gaining traction in like 2019 I gave them a cursory listen but immediately bounced off because
            I don't know, I'm stupid or something. When their second album released I listened to it and thought it was shit, then kept listening to it and realised I liked a few songs in particular. I then continued to listen to it and realised
            it was all actually pretty good. Then like two years later I listened to their first album again and I realised that was actually pretty fuckin sick too. Of course, that was the old Black Country, this is the new New Road. They may as well
            be different bands to me, even though the main difference is just the absence of one yelly guy. I really liked that yelly guy though, so I've been a little pessimistic on their more recent output. I didn't really like Live at Bush Hall when I listened
            to it, but that is not a unique experience for me and this band (I might still be waiting to turn on that one though). I've made my peace with their transition. There's enough Isaac-inclusive BCNR content out there for a guy like me, and 
            I am thankful to have two very good albums from that group. As it turns out, this new group is pretty good too.
