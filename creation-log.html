          <p>
            Today I submitted my assignment for my Interactive Media class. it
            is a website that is ok. not like this one which is great. speaking
            of which the other thing i did was make this page which will be for
            writing down what i do. not sure exactly what purpose this serves
            but it could be nice to look back on or maybe it will motivate me to
            work on things. this will not be daily because I dont want to do
            anything every day. The Daily Thing will also probably end up not
            being daily but im willing to take on that challenge for now. I also
            updated the site in general to make it work better. i think the
            comment box is still broken but thats probably for the best. i had
            to deactivate the custom cursor because it was fucked up and i
            couldnt fix it because i dont know how to fix ai written code or
            even really how to write human code but im working on it.
