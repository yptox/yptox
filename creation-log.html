<p> dialog is like fully implemented now, yippee. choice system is good, context based crosshair and cursor is good, ui is solid.
  also added a sort of basic text to speech function like in animal crossing which was fun. feels good! im pretty much set up to start 
  putting together the plot and map and everything, which maybe i should have done first but now i will do it. there's lots of other mechanics
  i intend to add like a title screen and save system + other menus and some sort of first-person playermodel but i need to take a break from that
  and focus on the worldbuilding for a little while. feeling good about it, things are coming together
</p>
          <h2>15-4-25</h2>
<p>Between class and working on "da game" I was at uni for 11 hours today which is a bit ridiculous but it felt kind of normal which is maybe a bit more ridiculous. I feel quite comfortable working there at this point which is a good thing because it looks like I am going to 
  have to quite a lot for at least the next little while. Holy scrap I am so fucking excited for my PC to arrive so I can make the one million creation. Anyway today I did shit for interactive Media - I feel I have a good understanding of Javascript and web stuff as a whole at this point.
  Obviously I am not an expert at all and I am still leaning heavily on learning resources but I feel like there's not too much I couldn't figure out to do given a decent amount of time. Got decent ideas for the next assignment so will start putting that together over the next little while.
  Something I have been explicitly not doing is working on my UX assignment. I really need to stop putting it off and just get to it. Tomorrow. Maybe I should bring the paper shit w me to Uni so I can get some more tests under my belt. Anyway, despite staying for like four hours after class 
  finished I only really managed to do one thing for the game, which was update the dialog ui. I'm pretty happy with how it is at the moment, definitely needs improving but feels a lot cleaner and readable and also fits w the aesthetic and psx type vibes. Definitely shouldn't have taken as long
  as it did though. Next steps are mapping out "da map" and then mapping out "da plot" and then mapping out "da user interaction". Maybe plot first, then map then ux. or maybe plot then ux then map. Honestly whatever way I do it im gonna have to go back and add shit so i may as well just get started.
  Really freaking enjoying it though. Have not felt this creatively motivated maybe ever in my life? Gel yeah

<h2>13-4-25</h2>
<p>Was at uni for abt 8 hours after getting some coffee with Luca Stevens, my good friend and Buddy. I spent a lot of time trying to get the dialog working which really could have been avoided by trying nodecanvas again or downloading something else online but oh well.
  I wish I could say I at least learned from the process by doing it myself but I didn't really, my good friend and Buddy Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental wrote almost all of the code with very minor changes by myself. I did spend around 6 hours trying to get it to do it an a way
  that wouldnt instantly break, so that counts for something I guess. I do understand how the system works which is more than I could say for previous scripts I've had AI write for me so maybe I am getting somewhere. I also put together some prototype UI elements for how the 
  dialogue might look.

          <h2> 10-4-25</h2>

       <p> Brought my external SSD with the unity project on it to uni so I could work on it, but ran into issues
        with the editor version. Spent like two hours trying to convert it but wasn't able to because I needed admin
        access. Turns out they had the version I needed on different PCs so I had to convert it back. I then spent a bunch
        of time working on modeling this jelly guy. Worked on trying to set up nodecanvas in unity as well but kept getting
        errors so honestly it might be easier to just do the dialogue system myself/with ai assistance. it really doesnt have to
        be that in depth considering the length of the game but yeah it has to actually work so we will see how it goes. New PC is on
        the way but it will probably be like two weeks before it arrives, so I will be spending a lot of time in the stu.</p>

          <h2> 9-4-25</h2>
          <p>Installed a bunch of shit in an attempt to get my project working on one of the uni 
            computers because my laptop is fried. I think I actually had the project saved on my 
            external hard drive but I didn't bring it today and I wanted to get some shit done. 
            Ended up not really getting any shit done, but at least the stuff is installed so next 
            time I can do some things. I did get the Unity MCP server working, and it is effectively
            useless. So much worse than just doing it myself. If there's something I can't do, or a 
            script I need, I can just google it or use a standalone AI model to figure it out. The model
            having access to the unity file sounds good but it has no fucking idea what it's doing, so there
            is really no point. Maybe there is some use, but I haven't been able to find it. Was a pain in the ass
            to set it up on the school computers too. Oh well, at least now I know. I'm going to have to
            do a lot on the studio PCs for the next little while until I can get a new home machine. Very annoying
            but I did need an upgrade. Would have rather done it on my own terms than at the whim of a fried motherboard but 
            these things happen!

            Updated site. finally got the comments working. they require moderation
            and approval for each one but thats probably a good thing actually. have 
            not done much otherwise, my laptop has stopped working so im doing shit 
            on my ipad in the meantime which works but i cant do unity stuff which is 
            a shame because i really want to keep working on my game. i need to properly
            get started on it if i want it to be done by the time its due. we will see how 
            it goes. enjoying the web site though

            Lost my mind today. Filmed myself dancing in front of my green
            screen then went through a bunch of incoherent footage from my
            camcorder from 2021-23. Made a little video that I actually really
            liked. Was weird to work on a video project again, especially after
            going through all my old footage and projects. It came together very
            easily and pleasantly. Maybe video is not so bad. I like doing
            something I know how to do. I like making things. should keep that
            up

            Today I submitted my assignment for my Interactive Media class. it
            is a website that is ok. not like this one which is great. speaking
            of which the other thing i did was make this page which will be for
            writing down what i do. not sure exactly what purpose this serves
            but it could be nice to look back on or maybe it will motivate me to
            work on things. this will not be daily because I dont want to do
            anything every day. The Daily Thing will also probably end up not
            being daily but im willing to take on that challenge for now. I also
            updated the site in general to make it work better. i think the
            comment box is still broken but thats probably for the best. i had
            to deactivate the custom cursor because it was fucked up and i
            couldnt fix it because i dont know how to fix ai written code or
            even really how to write human code but im working on it.
