        Brought my external SSD with the unity project on it to uni so I could work on it, but ran into issues
        with the editor version. Spent like two hours trying to convert it but wasn't able to because I needed admin
        access. Turns out they had the version I needed on different PCs so I had to convert it back. I then spent a bunch
        of time working on modeling this jelly guy. Worked on trying to set up nodecanvas in unity as well but kept getting
        errors so honestly it might be easier to just do the dialogue system myself/with ai assistance. it really doesnt have to
        be that in depth considering the length of the game but yeah it has to actually work so we will see how it goes. New PC is on
        the way but it will probably be like two weeks before it arrives, so I will be spending a lot of time in the stu.

          <p>Installed a bunch of shit in an attempt to get my project working on one of the uni 
            computers because my laptop is fried. I think I actually had the project saved on my 
            external hard drive but I didn't bring it today and I wanted to get some shit done. 
            Ended up not really getting any shit done, but at least the stuff is installed so next 
            time I can do some things. I did get the Unity MCP server working, and it is effectively
            useless. So much worse than just doing it myself. If there's something I can't do, or a 
            script I need, I can just google it or use a standalone AI model to figure it out. The model
            having access to the unity file sounds good but it has no fucking idea what it's doing, so there
            is really no point. Maybe there is some use, but I haven't been able to find it. Was a pain in the ass
            to set it up on the school computers too. Oh well, at least now I know. I'm going to have to
            do a lot on the studio PCs for the next little while until I can get a new home machine. Very annoying
            but I did need an upgrade. Would have rather done it on my own terms than at the whim of a fried motherboard but 
            these things happen!

            Updated site. finally got the comments working. they require moderation
            and approval for each one but thats probably a good thing actually. have 
            not done much otherwise, my laptop has stopped working so im doing shit 
            on my ipad in the meantime which works but i cant do unity stuff which is 
            a shame because i really want to keep working on my game. i need to properly
            get started on it if i want it to be done by the time its due. we will see how 
            it goes. enjoying the web site though

            Lost my mind today. Filmed myself dancing in front of my green
            screen then went through a bunch of incoherent footage from my
            camcorder from 2021-23. Made a little video that I actually really
            liked. Was weird to work on a video project again, especially after
            going through all my old footage and projects. It came together very
            easily and pleasantly. Maybe video is not so bad. I like doing
            something I know how to do. I like making things. should keep that
            up

            Today I submitted my assignment for my Interactive Media class. it
            is a website that is ok. not like this one which is great. speaking
            of which the other thing i did was make this page which will be for
            writing down what i do. not sure exactly what purpose this serves
            but it could be nice to look back on or maybe it will motivate me to
            work on things. this will not be daily because I dont want to do
            anything every day. The Daily Thing will also probably end up not
            being daily but im willing to take on that challenge for now. I also
            updated the site in general to make it work better. i think the
            comment box is still broken but thats probably for the best. i had
            to deactivate the custom cursor because it was fucked up and i
            couldnt fix it because i dont know how to fix ai written code or
            even really how to write human code but im working on it.
