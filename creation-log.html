            Updated site. finally got the comments working. they require moderation
            and approval for each one but thats probably a good thing actually. have 
            not done much otherwise, my laptop has stopped working so im doing shit 
            on my ipad in the meantime which works but i cant do unity stuff which is 
            a shame because i really want to keep working on my game. i need to properly
            get started on it if i want it to be done by the time its due. we will see how 
            it goes. enjoying the web site though

            Lost my mind today. Filmed myself dancing in front of my green
            screen then went through a bunch of incoherent footage from my
            camcorder from 2021-23. Made a little video that I actually really
            liked. Was weird to work on a video project again, especially after
            going through all my old footage and projects. It came together very
            easily and pleasantly. Maybe video is not so bad. I like doing
            something I know how to do. I like making things. should keep that
            up

            Today I submitted my assignment for my Interactive Media class. it
            is a website that is ok. not like this one which is great. speaking
            of which the other thing i did was make this page which will be for
            writing down what i do. not sure exactly what purpose this serves
            but it could be nice to look back on or maybe it will motivate me to
            work on things. this will not be daily because I dont want to do
            anything every day. The Daily Thing will also probably end up not
            being daily but im willing to take on that challenge for now. I also
            updated the site in general to make it work better. i think the
            comment box is still broken but thats probably for the best. i had
            to deactivate the custom cursor because it was fucked up and i
            couldnt fix it because i dont know how to fix ai written code or
            even really how to write human code but im working on it.
